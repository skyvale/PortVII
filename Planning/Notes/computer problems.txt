Computer Problems:

-- Audio (specifically headphones) disconnecting after Sleep.
   I have to unplug them and replug them to get them to work.

-- Background programs like my tablet driver and Wallpaper Engine randomly crash.
   Wallpaper Engine crashes upon Sleep or Restart.

-- Programs that use audio (games, internet browser stuff like youtube, etc) freeze 
   when opened. Occasionally, this can be fixed by just waiting for it to unfreeze for
   a few minutes. Or, restarting my computer completely. Normally I just have to
   restart.

What I've tried:

-- Shutting down and restarting computer
-- Updating my audio drivers
-- Deleting and re-downloading my audio drivers
-- Plugging my headphones into different USBs
